# Python Projects

This will be my Python Projects folder for everything Python related in my studies with The Tech Academy

## Basic Projects
* [WebPage Generator](https://github.com/adschaff/Python-Projects/blob/main/web_page_generator.py)
* [A Basic FileTransfer APP](https://github.com/adschaff/Python-Projects/blob/main/file_transfer.py)
* [A cute prompt and response game](https://github.com/adschaff/Python-Projects/blob/main/nice_or_mean.py)

Additionally -- in a separate repository I worked on several Django based projects

## Django Projects
* [Checkbook App Project](https://github.com/adschaff/CheckBook_Project)
* [Basic University Backend](https://github.com/adschaff/Django_Project)


## Basic Projects
The basic projects were key in developing my fundamental knowledge of Python and I was able to get all 3 functionoing with no errors. The first allows you to generate a basic webpage and make additional tweaks using Tkinter.

The file transfer project was key in my understanding of GUI. 

## Django Projects
The Checkbook App and the Basic University Backend both made use of virtual environments and using the terminal to run the server for both projects. I became comfortable within Django directories and resources while also learning how to use the Terminal for a series of commands.
